# Stock Analysis 

## Overview

### Purpose 
This analysis was done on behalf of Steve and his parents. They are seeking to make informed decisions on the stock market and where best to invest their money. In order to do this, a code was written and then refactored. Refactoring the code does two primary things, it cleaned up the initial code so it can be easily read through, and it also decreased the time it takes to run through the coding for greater efficiency. 

## Results
