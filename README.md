# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of The Project 
  Stocks are a tricky thing to track, which why Steve approached us, his parents have been looking into investing and choose stocks they way many of us do, familiarity. Steve wanted an easy, concrete way to show his parents various stocks, and make well founded suggestions on which ones to invest in, and which are better left untouched. However, Steve and his parents want to look for trends, watching how th stocks progress year to year, with the algorithm created, he can now feed any year  with these tickers and track their trends. The display created, is user friendly, and walks the user through step by step. 
  
## Results 
There are two images to consider.
#### 2017 Stock Trends

This image shows a few things. It labels stocks by their tickers, it shows their starting value and ending value, the volume at which it was traded, and the percentage of change. In this, almost all stocks have increased in value, while one stock lost value. 

#### 2018 Stock Trends
![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106715300/176573134-227a8f4d-2423-4196-95f1-1d15ee7bbb12.png)

This image documents the changes of the same stocks from the prior image, and tracks where they started and ended for the year 2018. As shown, this year was significantly less successful for most of the stocks. These are the trends from which we pull our conclusions. 
#### Other notes to consider
  These images show one more important aspect, the processing time for the analysis to run is displayed when done. This allows Steve to examine the speed at which the code runs, and optimize down the line if he ever needs to increase the data set. 
#### Conclusions
Steve now has concrete numbers to deliver to his parents. I would recommend they invest differently based on their risk aversion levels. If they are risk averse, then a safe bet would be RUN or ENPH; they have gains two years in a row, but the price is so minimal that even a large return on it, doesn't make for a lot of gains. For Low risk aversion, I would suggest they invest in SEDG, without more data it is hard to say, but in 2017 it made significant gains, and the stock holders were really able to gain value, and while it did lose value in the 2018, the losses were minimal and the gains from the previous years were still there, this stock, if the more years indicate a trend, could be a very lucrative stock to invest in. 

### Summary 
This code has been refactored, with the goal that it could be adjusted by the user, or another coder. This "cleaned up" code describes each part of the process. The biggest Pro, is that Steve with a small amount of information is going to be able to adjust the code to apply to more years, and more tickers; he can use the timing function to determine how efficient the code is, and if it ever needs to be optimized another coder will be able to pick up where we left off. Refactoring code is not always helpful however, there might be small pieces of the code that get missed or lost in translation that are really beneficial to the code. 
#### How it affected our VBA coding
The pros of having code refactored, was apparent throughout the process. The code was less bulky and with each step clearly labelled, it created a sort of _psuedocode_. The next person to update this is going to have a clear map of what was done to to the code and how to change it. However, starting out without a psuedocode and trying to discren from the created to code into refactored code was difficult, and it is likely that pieces, possibly important ones were left behind.
