# Stock Analysis 

## Overview

### Purpose 
This analysis was done on behalf of Steve and his parents. They are seeking to make informed decisions on the stock market and where best to invest their money. In order to do this, a code was written and then refactored. Refactoring the code does two primary things, it cleaned up the initial code so it can be easily read through, and it also decreased the time it takes to run through the coding for greater efficiency. 

## Results

### Discussion of Images
These images have a lot of information. For the coder they indicate a more efficient code. For the user, they create a simplified view of the total gains of these stocks over the course of two years. 2017 was a good year for most every stock, while 2018 was a much more difficult year for almost every stock. These ups and downs are of course quite common in the stock market, so getting data for the years between 2019 and 2022 would provide further insights into the general health and growth of various stocks
### Conclusion on Choice
Steve's parents can now make decisions on where they was to put ther money, by judging by the starting and ending prices of the stocks, as well as the general gains and losses over the years. There are recommendations I would make based on their Risk Aversion levels. For High Risk Aversion, I would recommend ENPH, it has had a steady increase over the course of two years, but the increases are modest, and thuse if loss does occur it is likely to be minimal. For Moderate Risk Aversion, I would recommend RUN, it also has had two good years, but the increases were more substantial and the cost higher, so if prices fall there is more to lose. For Low Risk Aversion, I would recommend SEDG (Contingent on more recent years); this stock gained a lot in 2017, and though it lost some in 2018, those losses were minimal compared to the prior gains, so there is potentially a lot to gain from investing in this stock. 
## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored Code
When code is refactored, it is "cleaned up" it is labeled and the excess is removed. This is helpful in that if I or another person were to come through the code could be changed and updated to include more years or more stocks; it also allows it to run more quickly because it isn't filtering through extra code. However there are a few disadvantages to this, namely, removing parts of code, means you might lose nuances that provide more accurate results or add in things that could make a difference to the overall functioning of the code. 
### How Refactoring Affected our Codes
For this code in particular, it made the code more efficient. The average run time decreased from .95 to about .83 seconds. Without losing any functionality of the code itself. Making this particular refactoring a success, and more useful than not
