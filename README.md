# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of The Project 
  Stocks are a tricky thing to track, which why Steve approached us, his parents have been looking into investing and choose stocks they way many of us do, familiarity. Steve wanted an easy, concrete way to show his parents various stocks, and make well founded suggestions on which ones to invest in, and which are better left untouched. However, Steve and his parents want to look for trends, watching how th stocks progress year to year, with the algorithm created, he can now feed any year  with these tickers and track their trends. The display created, is user friendly, and walks the user through step by step. 
  
## Results 
There are two images to consider.
#### 2017 Stock Trends

This image shows a few things. It labels stocks by their tickers, it shows their starting value and ending value, the volume at which it was traded, and the percentage of change. In this, almost all stocks have increased in value, while one stock lost value. 

#### 2018 Stock Trends
![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106715300/176573134-227a8f4d-2423-4196-95f1-1d15ee7bbb12.png)

This image documents the changes of the same stocks from the prior image, and tracks where they started and ended for the year 2018. As shown, this year was significantly less successful for most of the stocks. These are the trends from which we pull our conclusions. 
#### Other notes to consider
  These images show one more important aspect, the processing time for the analysis to run is displayed when done. This allows Steve to examine the speed at which the code runs, and optimize down the line if he ever needs to increase the data set. 
#### Conclusions
Steve now has concrete numbers to deliver to his parents
